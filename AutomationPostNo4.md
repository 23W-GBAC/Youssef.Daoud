#  Cost-benefit analysis of the project:

All in all, I'm mostly satisified with the end result but I wish to improve on it even further in the upcoming weeks or months. It does the job well enough and I'm not complaining but I would have at least liked if I could find a way to add the dates to the markdown files sooner than later, but I'll figure it out eventually.
I spent a few days brainstorming to be able to think of a simple enough solution for the issue at hand and then a couple of hours to search for how GitHub Actions work exactly and how I'm supposed to implement them in my repo. Coding the python script didn't take that long, all things considered. The whole approach didn't actually take that long to accomplish if I compare it to the previously tried attempts or apporaches that I've taken, which is a good thing too! I'd reckon I took about 3 to 4 days to get the whole thing up and running from A to Z. As for the resources, I'd say the only resources I really exhausted throughout those couple of days are time, and my energy. It took me so long to actually settle on a process to follow through with and then learning how to do the whole thing was quite exhausting and tedious, at least at first because things got easier the more I searched and practiced. The whole thing was an exercise in patience more than anything else; everytime I made a step forward, something came up that made me go two steps backward! It really got on my nerves a lot of times, more than I could remember, and there are still some parts of the code that I would have preferred to do differently but I got to the end of the problem at the end so I should be proud of that fact.

Within the next 5 years, I cannot say for sure how much time and resources I'll be saving with my automation exactly but I can already tell that despite its small scale, I've managed to get a lot off my shoulders through it. Saving and listing the exact last modified dates has helped me a lot with tracking when I last changed something, and even though GitHub has this feature already built-in it can be useful to know when the changes exactly happened by the minute and second too, something that GitHub doesn't show by default, also showing the dates to whoever vists my blog is defintitely a good thing for them too. I'd say this automation saves me about 5 or 6 minutes every day I write an article/post on, and over time these couple of minutes that are saved will more likely end up becoming hours, days, probably even weeks as I start churning out more and more articles and posts. As for resources, I'll end up saving my attention and energy to more important and worrying matters and things, and I'm sure as time goes on the benefits will only be more apparent to me. It's also helped me practice coding in general and that's definitely a plus too. In the end I think the resources and time I spent doing the whole thing and working hard on it were definitely well spent.

As for whether it's economicallyÂ beneficial or not, I'd argue that it can be beneficial in the long term; the whole process took me a couple of days to visualize and develop and and then just a couple of hours to fully code the python parts, and in return it'll help me save a quite a lot of time and energy over a long while, not to mention the potential improvements that can be thought of and applied to it mean that there's always room for improvement, such as for example setting up code so that the last modification dates are then displayed in each of their respective markdown files for the viewer to check, or as another example making it so that posts that have been edited/modified relatively soon to each other are put and grouped together. The possibilites are endless and I truly believe that there's some serious good use for the idea in the long-term, if everything is done properly to develop it.
## The Birth of Automation
Not too long ago, the process of manually tracking changes in a GitHub repository could be a tedious affair. Developers had to sift through numerous files, noting down modification dates, and keeping an eye on updates. Recognizing the need for efficiency, our team decided to embark on a mission to automate this process.

Enter Python, the versatile scripting language, and GitHub Actions, the automation powerhouse. A simple yet effective Python script was crafted to fetch the last modification dates of all markdown files within our repository. This script, when triggered every minute via GitHub Actions, promised to lift the burden off developers, allowing them to focus on more critical aspects of their work.

## The Cost-Benefit Equation
Now, let's break down the cost-benefit analysis of this automation endeavor. Initially, the development and implementation of the automation script required a modest investment of time and resources. A skilled developer spent a couple of days fine-tuning the script and integrating it seamlessly with GitHub Actions. This investment, however, proved to be a small price to pay for the long-term gains.

Over the next five years, the automation is poised to deliver substantial savings. No longer burdened with the manual tracking of file modifications, developers are projected to save countless hours collectively. Time that was once spent on routine, time-sensitive tasks can now be redirected towards innovation, collaboration, and problem-solving.

## Quantifying the Gains
To put it in perspective, let's consider the hourly rate of a developer. With the automation in place, the time saved equates to real monetary value. For instance, if a team of five developers each spends an average of one hour per day tracking file modifications, the cumulative time saved per week is 25 hours. Over a year, this amounts to a staggering 1,300 hours. In economic terms, this translates to substantial savings that can be reinvested in more strategic endeavors.

## Economic Benefits in Practice
The economic benefits extend beyond just the monetary savings. The newfound efficiency enhances overall productivity and morale within the development team. Freed from the monotony of repetitive tasks, developers can channel their creativity and energy towards problem-solving and innovation. This, in turn, contributes to a more vibrant and dynamic work environment.

Moreover, the automation minimizes the risk of human error associated with manual tracking. Developers no longer need to worry about missing crucial updates or overlooking file modifications. The script operates with precision, ensuring that every change is captured and recorded in a timely manner.

## Realizing the Vision
As we reflect on the journey from manual tracking to automated efficiency, it's evident that the decision to invest in automation has been a game-changer. The upfront costs were outweighed by the long-term benefits, and the impact on both productivity and economic value has been substantial.

In a rapidly evolving tech landscape, where time is a precious commodity, automation emerges as a strategic ally. It's not merely about saving time and resources; it's about unleashing the full potential of your development team. By automating routine tasks, you empower your developers to focus on what truly matters - building innovative solutions, fostering collaboration, and driving the success of your projects.

## Conclusion
In the realm of GitHub automation, our journey illustrates the tangible and intangible benefits that can be realized through a thoughtful cost-benefit analysis. By adopting a down-to-earth approach and steering clear of complicated jargon, we've highlighted the practicality and real-world impact of automation.

As the script diligently fetches modification dates every minute, it serves as a constant reminder of the power of automation to transform the way we work. In the end, it's not just about saving time; it's about investing in a future where developers can thrive, create, and make a lasting
