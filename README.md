# How much is too much screen time?
While the personal computer has become an integral part of our daily lives, transforming the way we work and communicate and many other things, the dark side of chronic computer usage is often overlooked. The adverse effects of using it too much mustn't be ignored or downplayed by anyone. Obesity, sleep problems, chronic neck and back problems, depression, and anxiety are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the negative effects brought upon by being on your computer for too long, and on this blog I will shed some light on them plus give some suggestions to attempt to remedy them when possible. I hope you enjoy reading through it. :) 
# Post no. 1: Why exactly do people spend too much time using their PCs to begin with?
In today's day and age, lots of people prefer spending time on their computers rather than doing anything else. What are the reasons behind this, you ask? Well,
one possible reason is that digital activities offer more convenience and variety than real ones. People can access a ton of information, entertainment, and social interactions with just a few clicks or taps and can also customize their experience to suit their preferences, needs, and moods however they want! For example, they can join online communities that share their values or hobbies.

The vast array of online content, social media platforms, and immersive gaming experiences creates a virtual world that can be difficult to resist. The constant connectivity facilitated by PCs also contributes to a sense of always being "plugged in," leading to extended screen time. Moreover, the convenience of working, socializing, and entertaining oneself from a single device makes it easy for individuals to lose track of time. The dopamine-driven feedback loops inherent in many digital activities, such as receiving notifications or achieving milestones in games, further reinforce the habit of prolonged computer use. As a result, individuals may unintentionally spend more time than they initially intended, impacting their physical health, mental well-being, and overall quality of life. It is essential for people to cultivate awareness and establish boundaries to maintain a healthy balance between their digital and real-world experiences.

It's important to find a balance between virtual and offline activities. Digital activities can enrich our lives, but they cannot replace the benefits of face-to-face interactions and outdoor experiences. We should use the computer as a tool, not as a substitute, for our social and personal development.
# Post no. 2: Negative effects of being on the PC too much.
The digital world has become an integral part of our daily existence. From socializing and working to shopping and entertainment, there's no end in sight to what can be done. But as we immerse ourselves in this digital ocean, it's essential to acknowledge the potential negative consequences of spending too much time in it.

One of the most significant issues that arise from the excessive usage of the computer is the impact on real-world relationships. It leads to social isolation, with individuals prioritizing virtual interactions over face-to-face connections. Meaningful relationships can be compromised, and the nuances of in-person communication may be lost, affecting the depth and quality of connections.

While computers are powerful tools for productivity, chronic usage without proper breaks can lead to burnout. The constant pressure to be connected and available can result in increased stress levels and decreased overall well-being.

Excessive computer usage can lead to digital addiction, where individuals become overly reliant on screens for work, social interaction, and entertainment. This addiction can contribute to feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression.

All in all, the PC has undoubtedly revolutionized and changed the way we live, work, and connect. It is crucial that we maintain a balance and be aware of the potential adverse effects of using it too much. By being aware of the impact it can have on several aspects of our lives, we can take steps to mitigate these risks and foster a healthier relationship with it. Remember, moderation is key to living a healthy life, and it's no different when it comes to this.
